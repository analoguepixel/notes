            <p>
              Mininotes is a personal project born out of dissatisfaction with popular note taking applications. It is designed to be fast and functional.
            </p>
            <h3>Main Goals of mininotes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Instant access</strong> - Allow a user to enter or view an note within three seconds of accessing the website/application.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Load quickly</strong> - The goal right now is that pages are small and load quicky. No page should exceed a 512kB download size.</li>
                  <li><strong>Operate quickly</strong> - Do not make the user wait more than needed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Scalable</strong> - Performance without pressure means nothing.</li>
              <li><strong>Support many platforms</strong> - Everyone deserves a chance to record their thoughts. Supporting the web first means more users can access the platform from the start.</li>
